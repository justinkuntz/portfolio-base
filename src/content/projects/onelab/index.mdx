OneLab focuses on sustainable health for employees, recognizing the connection between health, work environments, and profitability. They provide modern business health solutions to help companies support their staff’s well-being and performance.

ID—C has a long-standing partnership with OneLab, and for this project, we were invited to update their digital experiences by designing a new website, and further improve their digital products including designing new features and add-ons. The goal was to create a digital experience that reflects their commitment to a sustainable future while making their brand more welcoming and trustworthy.

Our solution combined functional aesthetics with an extended warmer color palette, inviting imagery, and smart digital features, all anchored by the Hemoglobin red – a key element of their brand identity.
